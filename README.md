## 🌿 About Us

Sanloop is a passionate **agri-startup** blending **science, sustainability, and soul**.

With the rise of lifestyle diseases and chemically-laden food, we took a stand — to restore clean, conscious eating through nature’s most potent greens: **Microgreens**.

- 📚 **Vertical Rack Farming** – Multi-layer racks save space, water & land  
- 🧺 **Tray-Based Rotation** – 2000+ trays, rotated every 12–15 days  
- 💧 **Clean On-Site Well Water** – Naturally filtered, mineral-rich  
- 🧼 **Hygienic Post-Harvest Processing** – Freshness and shelf life guaranteed  
- ♻️ **Zero-Waste Philosophy** – Surplus becomes juice, powders, chutneys, or compost
